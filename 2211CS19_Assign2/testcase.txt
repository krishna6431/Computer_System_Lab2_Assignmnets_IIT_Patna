//Testcase and Info File

Note : When You Run this program first it asks for if u want to add details or you just want to query on existing database;
       Press 1 if You want to add more details
       Press 0 if you want to Query on existing Database
       Rest of Instructions Follow Accordingly

/*In existing Database some of the details are already present*/

//Some of The Record Testset

2211CS100 8 8 7 7 6
2211AI001 6 6 7 8 7
2211EE099 7 7 8 8 7
2211CE109 10 9 9 8 8

//Some of Query Testset

Complexity Analysis:

Lets Say N = Number of details present into database 
writing files into database takes : O(N)
reading files from database takes : O(N)
Major operation is sorting Results in Worst case we need to sort all Results and we are using sort function of standard template library that takes O(NlogN) in worst case;
for printing the results Complexity : O(N);

So combining all : O(N) + O(N) + O(NlogN) + O(N)

So When we take upperbound Complexity it will be O(NlogN);

Space Complexity Will Be : O(N) 
we are storing atmax N details.


Thank You So Much
